Welcome to my GitHub profile! 👋

I am a 2nd year undergraduate student exploring various programming languages beyond my curriculum. Here on my GitHub profile, I keep track of my learning journey and store my projects and code from university.

## About Me 🙋‍♀️

- 🎓 I am currently pursuing my undergraduate degree in Computer Science.
- 💻 My interests include web development, machine learning, data science and some low level no GC languages.
- 🌱 I am always eager to learn new things and expand my skillset.

## Projects 🚀

Here are some of the projects I have worked on:

- 📊 **Data Analysis with Python**: A collection of Jupyter Notebooks containing my exploratory data analysis and visualization projects using Python and its popular libraries. This code was written during internship at Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń.
- 🎮 **Simple Games**: A collection of small games built with JavaScript, including a memory tic-tac-toe game and some other cli fun things.
- :crab: **Rust**: A morse code messenger with gRPC and terminal user interface, because I love Rust and I know morse code.

## University Repositories 📚

I also keep my university projects and assignments on my GitHub profile, including:

- 📝 **Data Structures and Algorithms**: Implementation of various data structures and algorithms in Java and Golang, including linked lists, trees, sorting algorithms, and more.
- 📊 **Database Management Systems**: SQL queries and projects involving database design and management using MySQL.
- 🌐 **Web Programming**: Projects using Angular to build single page web applications.
